      <img src="Hannah2021.jpg" width="125" height="142" style="float:right">
      <p>I studied chemical engineering at Oregon State University and graduated with my bachelors
of science in June 2021. Professionally I've worked extensively with manufacturing; including CNC machining,
3D printing, PCB repair, vacuum arc technologies, and aerospace.</p>
      <p>As a hobbyist, I prototype with Arduino and use the Arduino IDE.
 In my spare time I enjoy working on keyboard creation, anything RFID, target archery, and customizing
my Subaru Justy.</p>

    <h1 style="color: #4A3A5B">Automotive RFID Door</h1>
    <p>See full project details 
<a href="https://github.com/hannahgamache/AutomotiveRFID"> here. </a></p>
  <p> My goal for this project was to design and install an RFID reader to activate my car door actuators.
The biggest design challenge has been making something that would be able to read the signal at a tolerable distance while also being placed inside the car. This project is still in progress and im currently troubleshooting the relays and actuator wiring.<br></p>

  <h1 style="color:#4A3A5B">Lefty Keyboard</h1>
<p>See full project details <a href="link">here. </a></p>
<p>I've built a few keyboards from individual components and decided it was time to try a custom PCB creation.
I prefer full sized (109 keys) keyboards, which are much harder to find barebone PCBs for. I'm implementing a "lefty" feature where the numpad is to the left of the alphabetical keys. I'll be using KiCad for this project.</p>

  <h1 style="color:#4A3A5B">Game Pad</h1>
<p>See full project details <a href="link">here. </a></p>
<p>I experienced a unique issue while using mouse and keyboard for gaming, in that longer nails dont fit in the empty space between keycaps. To remedy this, I used a 16 switch board and custom 3D printed caps to allow proper spacing. This is a completed project.</p>
